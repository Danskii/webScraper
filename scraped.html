Without worrying about "getting it right" we can simply "get it down" and express how we really feel.</p><p>That's freedom. It's also freewriting. First coined as one word by Peter Elbow in the 1970s, freewriting isn't something new or even complicated. But it is powerful.</p><p>With more than 20 years' experience in education, Karen Filewych makes freewriting the backbone of her program and a game changer in any classroom. Class discussions might only engage a few students, Filewych explains, but freewriting gives each person a voice and a safe place to explore it. It helps students move past the barriers of fear, reluctance or insecurity and allows them to be more fluent and innovative in their writing. It's a powerful skill that goes far beyond language arts, too.</p><p>Teachers of all subjects and grades will find strategies to incorporate freewriting into their classroom. Filewych also provides dozens of simple but inspiring prompts, provides strategies for modelling positive feedback and gives suggestions on how to run writing groups. She also offers guidelines for student-teacher conferencing and recommends ways to support our English-language learners. </p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Caroline Pignat, OCT, is a two-time Governor General's Award-winning author.

Are we really present for whatever life may bring us? Or half the time, do our minds wander, thinking and worrying about something other than what we are actually doing? Distraction can be a huge problem for teaching young minds how to learn. This book details strategies for teachers to retrain those wandering brains and to introduce mindfulness into their classrooms.</p><p>The author describes how students can learn to regulate themselves when they encounter stressful situations by challenging a triad of internal roadblocks: their attention, their emotions and their behaviour. By following the suggested exercises, students can learn to identify their feelings while focusing on accomplishing tasks in a socially appropriate way.</p><p>Mindful breathing, sensing what's around them, recognizing their emotional landscape and using movement routines are all part of a step-by-step set of instructions to guide students toward mindfulness. Suggestions from other teachers who have implemented these strategies are incorporated, too, along with worksheets and templates for K–8 students.</p><p>This is a straightforward and thought-provoking book, designed to encourage teachers to prepare their students to thrive not just in school but also well beyond the classroom.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Teresa Ross, OCT, is a secondary school teacher with the Niagara Catholic District School Board.</span></p><p><cite>Fostering Mindfulness: Building skills that students need to manage their attention, emotions, and behavior in classrooms and beyond,</cite> Pembroke Publishers, Markham, Ont., 2019, softcover, ISBN 978-1-55138-340-8, 168 pages, $24.95, <a href="http://www.pembrokepublishers.com">pembrokepublishers.com</a></p><hr><figure><img class="photoReview" src="images/2020-06-Reviews-3-PS.jpg" alt="Photo of a book cover of 'Awâsis and the World-Famous Bannock.'

This book directly addresses the thinking piece, that most critical component of an effective education.</p><p>These are challenging times, when much is expected of the educational system. In response, many school systems around the world are integrating political, social, emotional and ethical learning into everyday classroom curricula. <cite>Powerful Understanding</cite> shows teachers how to connect the dots for students to deepen understanding and interact with the world around them as they construct meaning. </p><p>As the author of the transformative <cite>Reading Power,</cite> Adrienne Gear has always sought to expand awareness and to sharpen critical thinking beyond the confines of the classroom. This book takes it a few steps further by including both teachers and students in a more profound learning process that not only helps students become more reflective learners but shows us, as teachers, how to develop and reflect on our own understanding of the content we teach.</p><p>The resource is designed as a guide for teachers of all grades and is packed with practical classroom lessons, exemplars, photocopy-ready pages and a number of book lists. Full of great ideas and solid philosophy, <cite>Powerful Understanding</cite> is a worthwhile resource for engaging all those curious learners in our classrooms.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Janet Cottreau, OCT, is executive director of a leadership and family camp near Ottawa.</span></p><p><cite>Powerful Understanding: Helping students explore, question, and transform their thinking about themselves and the world around them</cite>, Pembroke Publishers, Markham, Ont., 2018, softcover, ISBN 978-1-55138-328-6, 176 pages, $24.95,        <a href="http://www.pembrokepublishers.com">pembrokepublishers.com</a></p><hr><figure><img class="photoReview" src="images/2020-03-Reviews-2-PS.jpg" alt="Photo of a book cover for 'Making Sense of Number, K-10.'

The book guides teachers in structuring learning around key concepts — quantity, counting, relating and representing; all developed across the various strands — patterning and algebra, numbers and operations, measurement, geometry, and data and probability for  Grades K–10. </p><p>Each chapter has a similar layout, structured for ease of use. The book includes everything needed to generate effective lesson plans, including the big ideas, classroom vignettes, making sense of concepts, prompts to guide thinking, and assessing when student understanding kicks into place.</p><p>One important part of the book is a short discussion about prior attitudes, particularly the attitudes of parents toward mathematics. If parents believe math is primarily formulas and calculations for example, they will need opportunities to see the broader value of math and its applications to new contexts. Early in the year, the authors suggest, it's helpful to provide parents with lots of math support. Strengthening the parent-child bond has a profound impact on learning, especially in mathematics, where grasping the abstract concepts of numerical thinking often require reinforcement at home.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Mary Veronica Moloney, OCT, teaches Grade 3/4 at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School in Toronto.</span></p><p><cite>Making Sense of Number, K–10: Getting to know your students so you can support the development of their mathematical understanding</cite>,        Pembroke Publishers, Markham, Ont., 2018, softcover, ISBN 978-1-55138-332-3, 140 pages, $24.95, <a href="http://www.pembrokepublishers.com">pembrokepublishers.com</a></p><hr><figure><img class="photoReview" src="images/2020-03-Reviews-3-PS.jpg" alt="Photo of a book cover for 'Asking Better Questions.'

Add "education" to your search, and you'll whittle that result down, but only a bit. As an educator, this may not be entirely surprising. We've all been there. Some days, when we ask questions of our students the energy is electric. Other days we hear crickets chirping. That's where this book comes to the rescue.</p><p>The authors have organized questions into three essential categories: questions that elicit information, those that shape understanding, and those that promote reflection. The key question driving the text is how can we encourage deep learning and generate engaged conversations about things that matter. The authors explore the questions both within traditional media and within the dynamic digital world. That leads to an analysis of how questions are asked now compared to in the past, touching on the current age of "post-truth" in which we find ourselves.</p><p>With genuine engagement, students can begin to question the veracity and relevance of everything they come across. Is it true, false or embellished? Students become the questioners, taking on more responsibility for their own learning.

For example, in September, a month when we're surrounded by new people, she suggests that teachers focus on building community. The final chapter, May, is a time to celebrate and appreciate our accomplishments during the course of the previous school year. Using this framework, she invites educators to recognize that our ability to build resilience will be directly affected by the ebbs and flows of a typical school year.</p><p>Readers of Brené Brown or Eckhart Tolle will recognize descriptions of key behaviours that lead to resilience: allowing ourselves to be vulnerable, facing our fears, speaking without hostility, and striving for clarity in our communication. She offers clear strategies to strengthen these behaviours that apply equally to relationships among teachers and between teachers and students.   </p><p>As we studied the book, my colleagues and I engaged in meaningful conversations, reflecting on what it means to be resilient, and how it is possible for educators, as agents of change, to help our students become empowered learners and citizens.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Wilma Aalbers, OCT, is a teacher-librarian with the Upper Grand District School Board.</span></p><p><cite>Onward: Cultivating Emotional Resilience in Educators</cite>,        Jossey-Bass, a Wiley Brand, Hoboken, N.J., 2018, softcover, ISBN 978-1-119-36489-4, 384 pages, $41.95,        <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-ca">wiley.com</a></p><hr><div class="imageContentWrapper" style="clear: both;"><figure><img class="photoReview" src="images/2020-03-Reviews-5-PS.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" alt="Photo of a book cover for A Girl Called Echo: Vol. 2.

Henderson and Donovan Yaciuk (colourist)</p></div><p>Two recent YA graphic novels by Indigenous women bring to life the struggles and experiences of teenage Indigenous girls.</p><p><cite>Surviving the City</cite> tells the story of Miikwan and Dez, who are inseparable at school. They have recently finished their berry fast, a ceremony teenage girls undertake to prepare for womanhood. Dez lives with her Kokum (grandmother) and fears she may be placed in a group home if her grandmother becomes too ill to care for her. Miikwan is grieving her mother, who is missing and presumed murdered. When Dez disappears one night, Miikwan fears she has lost her best friend in the same way she lost her mother. Under the guidance of the Indigenous culture worker at school, Miikwan makes an offer to the Creator asking for Dez's safe return, and then takes part in a march in honour of missing and murdered Indigenous women and two-spirited people, before Dez is ultimately found and the two are reunited. </p><p>The importance of community, especially a community of women, is a running theme throughout the book. Many of the scenes include female spirits who accompany Miikwan and Dez throughout their days, guiding and protecting them against the threatening male spirits who also follow the girls.</p><p>In <cite>Red River Resistance</cite>, we follow Echo as she strives to find her place in a large Winnipeg school. As in the previous volume about her, Echo misses her mother, who is living in an unnamed facility. She spends much of her day with earbuds shoved in her ears, playing her mother's old playlist. The book's cover art accentuates her longing with its muted colours and the bright white earbuds that stand out, highlighting not only her solitude, but her connection with her mother. </p><p>Vol. 2 also resumes Echo's journey to the past. One ordinary afternoon in class, she finds herself transported to the summer of 1869, witnessing the Red River Resistance first-hand.</p><p>The first volume of this series found Echo fumbling to find her identity. In Vol. 2 she is becoming more comfortable with herself and her heritage. She joins the Indigenous leadership group at school, and begins to make friends. History class awakens an interest in her Métis heritage. We even glimpse a bit of a smile from Echo now and then, and the reader is left looking forward to Echo's journey in the upcoming Vol. 3.</p><p>Both of these texts would be welcome additions to a secondary school library or classroom, or to an Indigenous Studies or Indigenous Literature curriculum.

Teachers can also discuss age-appropriate strategies with their students and prompt them to think about how they can use their voices to become robust bulwarks against the bully. In highlighting our differences, this book conversely shows how we are more similar than different, and how we can use that to overcome bullying with acceptance, empathy and appreciation for one another.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Caroline Cremer, OCT, teaches a Grade 2/3 class at Leslieville Junior Public School in Toronto.</span></p><p><cite>I Didn't Stand Up</cite>,        Clockwise Press, Keswick, Ont., 2018, hardcover, ISBN 978-1-988347-06-6, 32 pages, $19.95,        <a href="http://clockwisepress.com/">clockwisepress.com</a>, distributed by Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside, <a href="https://www.fitzhenry.ca/">fitzhenry.ca</a></p><hr><figure><img class="photoReview" src="images/2020-03-Reviews-8-PS.jpg" alt="Photo of a book cover for 'The Cold Little Voice.'

You know, the one that tells you you're not good enough or smart enough or normal or capable or special in any way. This picture book brings that voice to life.</p><p>The story is simple. A young child shares the intimate musings of their inner voice and the illustrator paints a clear picture of what that deafening, intrusive inner critic looks like and how it changes who you are and how you feel about yourself.</p><p>But the book is also about how you can turn that voice off, and how that cold little voice can be replaced with something warmer and kinder.</p><p>The author shares the effects of listening to a subversive inner judge and, more importantly, what happens when you start to appreciate your strengths, your uniqueness and what makes you you. Even though it is a picture book, <cite>The Cold Little Voice </cite>is appropriate for all ages. Primary students can appreciate the simple story it tells and older students, many of whom might be dealing with the anxiety of adolescence, can dig into the deeper feelings of inadequacy and not being good enough while they explore connections, writing style and artistic elements.

It's an appropriate question for students of all ages. Even as adults, many of us are still on a personal journey of growth and self-discovery. </p><p>While it's written for a target audience between five and nine years of age, this vibrant picture book is a resource that can be appreciated by anyone contemplating what they want to be when they grow up and, perhaps even more importantly, the kind of person they want to become. The protagonist, a student named Dylan, is asked this common career-minded question for a class assignment. Students will relate to his initial reaction of anxiety at not knowing the answer. </p><p>This book would be a great tool to start a dialogue with children about their future, either linked to a formal unit of study, or worked into everyday lessons and teachable moments. It can be connected to the theme of how to prepare students for the careers of the future and for 21st-century leadership. </p><p>For parents and teachers who want to advance and enrich the conversation, there are free downloadable lesson plans, worksheets and a parent guide available on <a href="https://www.whodoiwanttobecome.com/">whodoiwanttobecome.com</a>.

Moved by these physical scars, and devoted to her mother, the little girl vows that she will always stay with her in the fields. </p><p>Her mother, however, insists her daughter venture beyond the fields and take advantage of the opportunities that await her — opportunities her mother will never have.

The lucky ones get that wish. </p><p>Through gentle and delicate details, the illustrator alternates between revealing the harsh realities of life in this small village and the endless possibilities that lie before the young girl, while still leaving much to the imagination. </p><p>The rhythm and light repetition of the text will appeal to younger readers.

As the author says, our students today are part of the “writingest” generation in history. Students’ ability to write has become an essential skill and quite possibly a predictor of future success. This book addresses the need to meet students where they are so they can learn to take full advantage of the written word as they use technology to share ideas. It also highlights how different formats and audiences require different writing conventions.  </p><p>Rog has divided the book into three sections: organizing the workshop, unit planning, and content, craft and conventions. Minilessons with catchy names like “Chunk and Chew, Stop and Jot,” “Slo-Mo Writing” and “What Does Red Sound Like?” are designed to help make student writing pop. Rog uses the memorable acronym TAG: <span class="nonSemanticItalics">Tell</span> something you like in the piece of writing, <span class="nonSemanticItalics">Ask</span> questions, and <span class="nonSemanticItalics">Give </span>advice.  </p><p>The book offers everything teachers in Grades 3–8 need to plan for a year of writing instruction — unit plans, rubrics, assessment tools, mentor texts and blackline masters.

Krista’s mother always hides the odour by tying a plastic bag over the container. But Grandma doesn’t, and Krista thinks that even the milk in Grandma’s fridge tastes like kimchi. </p><p>Krista is the only Korean-Canadian in her Vancouver classroom. She has a few big problems as she enters Grade 5. First, she feels like she’s being pulled away from her best friend, Jason, by her new friends at school. And she feels conflicted about being the Korean ambassador for her school’s Heritage Month. She foresees the class asking her embarrassing questions about Korea and being made fun of when she offers her answers.

When Rukhsana’s brother offers to help, he is told that boys must save their energy for their studies. It is Rukhsana’s responsibility to learn to make such dishes for her future husband.</p><p>One afternoon, Rukhsana arrives home from school to find her entire family sitting around the dining table looking at a letter that says she been accepted to Caltech on a full scholarship. Not only is her dream of becoming a physicist one step closer to reality, but perhaps her dream of living a life without secrets and lies might be, too. </p><p>This book would be a rich novel study for students in Grade 10 and up.

You can start by simply listening. This anthology, told by Indigenous people, tells the histories that are not included in our textbooks. With the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, 11 authors and almost as many illustrators share the stories of their ancestors in an unprecedented compilation. Traditionally, Indigenous narratives have only been told orally, passed on from one generation to the next. More recently, these accounts have been written down but rarely in graphic short story format. Given the rise in legitimacy, popularity and accessibility of the graphic novel form, these Indigenous stories are now more accessible than ever and likely more appealing to young people. Nations including Chippewas of Nawash, Métis, Mi’kmaq, Cree, Tuscarora and others are represented. The content is suited for ages 15 and up but, if carefully scaffolded, teachers could successfully introduce it to Grade 6 students for social studies and Grade 7–8 students for history curriculums. It would also be a solid addition to the Grade 12 curriculum as it specifically addresses social, political, economic and cultural challenges in Indigenous communities. Most importantly, the collection points Indigenous students toward seeing themselves, hearing their own voices and stories, and reading about the perspectives of their ancestors and their communities.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticBold">Jennifer Wyatt, OCT, is head of the junior school at Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ont.</span></p><p><cite>This Place: 150 Years Retold</cite>, Highwater Press, an imprint of Portage &amp; Main Press, Winnipeg, 2019, softcover, ISBN 978-1-55379-758-6, 287 pages, $36, <a href="http://www.highwaterpress.com">highwaterpress.com</a></p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=octcollege"></script><div id="_atssh" style="visibility: hidden; height: 1px; width: 1px; position: absolute; top: -9999px; z-index: 100000;"><iframe id="_atssh85" title="AddThis utility frame" src="https://s7.addthis.com/static/sh.f48a1a04fe8dbf021b4cda1d.html#rand=0.7410692093440345&amp;iit=1599004943763&amp;tmr=load%3D1599004943694%26core%3D1599004943748%26main%3D1599004943757%26ifr%3D1599004943766&amp;cb=0&amp;cdn=0&amp;md=0&amp;kw=&amp;ab=-&amp;dh=professionallyspeakingtest&amp;dr=&amp;du=http%3A%2F%2Fprofessionallyspeakingtest%2Fpublications%2Fprofessionally_speaking%2F2019-12%2F2019-12-Reviews-PS.asp&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Fprofessionallyspeakingtest%2Fpublications%2Fprofessionally_speaking%2F2019-12%2F2019-12-Reviews-PS.asp&amp;dt=Reviews%20%7C%20Professionally%20Speaking%20December%202019&amp;dbg=0&amp;cap=tc%3D0%26ab%3D0&amp;inst=1&amp;jsl=0&amp;prod=undefined&amp;lng=en&amp;ogt=&amp;pc=men&amp;pub=octcollege&amp;ssl=0&amp;sid=5f4ee10f791767df&amp;srf=0.01&amp;ver=300&amp;xck=0&amp;xtr=0&amp;og=&amp;csi=undefined&amp;rev=v8.28.7-wp&amp;ct=1&amp;xld=1&amp;xd=1" style="height: 1px; width: 1px; position: absolute; top: 0px; z-index: 100000; border: 0px; left: 0px;"></iframe></div><style id="service-icons-0"></style><script src="/publications/language-toggle.js"></script><div class="psTOC styleRefreshDec2018"><header><div class="topnav" id="myTopnav"><a href="/publications/professionally_speaking/archives/back_issues.aspx"><img id="headerNavLogo" src="/publications/professionally_speaking/profesionally-speaking.png" alt="Professionally Speaking"></a><div class="headerNavItemWrapper"><a href="../archives/back_issues.aspx"><div class="navOptions">Archives</div></a><a href="#" onclick="document.location.href=changeENGtoFRE();"><div class="navOptions"><em>Pour parler profession</em></div></a><a href="https://www.oct.ca/"><div class="navOptions">oct.ca</div></a></div></div></header><div id="addThisWrapper" class="share_content_top"><div id="sharePageCopy">Share this page&nbsp;</div><div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox"></div></div></div><div class="psReviews styleRefreshDec2018"><div class="toc-title"><h1>Reviews</h1></div><div class="subHeading"><p>Your guide to recently released books and other teaching resources.</p><p><span class="nonSemanticItalics">For additional reviews of French-language resources, visit</span> <a href="/publications/pour_parler_profession/2019-09/2019-09-Reviews-PPP.asp"><lang="fr-ca">Pour parler profession</lang="fr-ca"></a>. <span class="nonSemanticItalics">With the exception of some classroom sets, items reviewed are available on loan from the Margaret Wilson Library at the College.
